# problems I had

I had issues with the navbar burger button. once the nav bar was extended on the phone it would not go back if pressed again. This coding issue led me back to my bootstrap script code (which was in the body twice). I thought this might have been an issue in the css code maybe with conflicting codes but Removing the redundant script resolved the issue, allowing the navbar to toggle open and close as expected on mobile.

I also had issues with making the overlay text on the image smaller for the mobile i was unable to do it and i am stil trying to find a way to make it mobile friendly.

I had issues with the navbar and making it the same gradient all the way through once i added the bootstarp nav button for mobile it moved the whole navbar options into the top left corner and also created a white box around the text making the navbar look strange showing 2 colours. I had to innovate and make the white box a more stronger gradient which made it look like it was popping out, this was totally unintended but i kept it in because mistakes make something unique.

When the nav bar was moved to the top left, I struggled to move it back. even though i planned for the website heading and the nav options to be seperate in the wireframes i chose to deal with it and focus on other important things.
