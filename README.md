# problems I had

I had issues with the navbar burger button. once the nav bar was extended on the phone it would not go back if pressed again. This coding issue led me back to my bootstrap script code (which was in the body twice). I thought this might have been an issue in the css code maybe with conflicting codes but Removing the redundant script resolved the issue, allowing the navbar to toggle open and close as expected on mobile.

I also had issues with making the overlay text on the image smaller for the mobile i was unable to do it and i am stil trying to find a way to make it mobile friendly.

I had issues with the navbar and making it the same gradient all the way through once i added the bootstarp nav button for mobile it moved the whole navbar options
